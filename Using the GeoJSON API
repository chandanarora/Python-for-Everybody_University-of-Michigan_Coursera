Calling a JSON API

In this assignment you will write a Python program that will prompt for a location, contact a web service and retrieve JSON for the web service and parse that data, and retrieve the first place_id from the JSON. A place ID is a textual identifier that uniquely identifies a place as within Google Maps.

API End Points
To complete this assignment, you should use this API endpoint that has a static subset of the Google Data:
http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/json?

This API uses the same parameter (address) as the Google API. This API also has no rate limit so you can test as often as you like. If you visit the URL with no parameters, you get "No address..." response.

To call the API, you need to provide address that you are requesting as the address= parameter that is properly URL encoded using the urllib.urlencode() fuction.
#my code
import urllib.request, urllib.parse, urllib.error
import json

serviceurl='http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/json?'

address=input("Enter location: ")
parms=dict()
api_key = 42
parms["address"]=address
parms['key'] = api_key
url=serviceurl+urllib.parse.urlencode(parms)
print("Retrieving", url)
uh=urllib.request.urlopen(url)
data=uh.read().decode()
print("Rertieved", len(data), "characters")

json_data=json.loads(data)
place=json_data["results"][0]["place_id"]
print(place)
